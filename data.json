The author suggests that the copy found at Ebla is not local, but imported (most likely from/through Mari). He briefly comments on the colophon, which bears in fact the name of scribe \\emph{Ir}\\textsubscript{3}-\\emph{za-il} and a praise to god Zababa \u201cking of Ki\u0161\u201d. He further proceeds on a comparison between the Abu Salabikh and Eblaite versions, observing several differences in content and palaeography (178-179; see also tables I-II). As a result of this analysis, the author concludes that the Ebla copy does not come directly from Abu Salabikh. He further comments on the content of the list, suggesting that it does not represent an actual personnel roster, but rather a scribal exercise. On pages 181-189 the full edition of the Ebla tablet is presented, followed by correspondences with the Abu Salabikh versions and indexes. Contains four pictures of the Ebla version.

These tablets, referred to as the annual accounts of silver and gold are date to different periods. The tablets from the first phase, attributed to minister Ibrium, have fifteen to nineteen columns on both sides. As Ebla's economic power increased under Ibbi-Zikir, the tablets grew larger, exceeding twenty columns. The accounts show a significant progression in silver quantities over time. For example, one tablet records an outflow of 100.49 mines of silver, while another reports an outflow of 273.46 silver minas and 437 mines from the treasury. The tablets also occasionally provide information related to chronology. Some colophons mention the passage of time, such as \"2 mu\" or \"x mu \u00e9 en diri.\" The annual nature of these documents is further demonstrated by periodic cult offerings, including those for the god Hadda in the third and eighth months, as well as the presence of two bracelets for the gods Ammarig and A\u0161dabil in all complete texts.\n\\par\nThe longest documents in the collection refer to events that span several months, although the chronological order is not always maintained. The AAMs serve as a supporting backbone for arranging the remaining epigraphic material in chronological order.",

In addition, Archi also takes into consideration~\\emph{ti-ne-ib}\u2082-\\emph{du-rum'}s consecration as priestess (DAM.DINGIR). After a detailed analysis of the gifts delivered on these occasions, Archi concludes that upon their deaths women received the same set of garments and jewels delivered to them on the occasion of their weddings. He further proceeds describing the full set of garments and jewels generally delivered to high ranking women upon these occasions. He then investigates the gifts generally brought by the deceased to their ancestors, and concludes with a few remarks on the wailing rite. A detailed index of the jewels considered in this study is included.

It is clear today that the term is connected to the funerary sphere and is variously translated as \u201ccemetery\u201d, \u201ctomb\u201d, or \u201cfunerary ceremony\u201d. Any more precise connotation has not been yet suggested. For a recent account on the lexical evidence regarding this term, see Hajouz 2013, 274-275.

After a few introductory remarks on the kind of kin relationships tying them to the court, Biga introduces the dam en lists (which will be further investigated by Tonietti in 1989).

Biga delves into various passages within two documents to shed light on this significant event. The first document, TM.75.G.1249, provides evidence of a meeting at Armi involving Minister Ibbi-zikir, envoys from Ki\u0161, and the king of Nagar accompanied by his son. Subsequently, the king of Nagar and his entourage followed Ibbi-zikir to Ebla, where they discussed the marriage agreement between Tagri\u0161-damu and the son of Nagar's king. The second source, TM.75.G.1250, documents the wedding ceremony itself, along with the exchange of several gifts, including those given to the bride. Biga explores the distinct stages that mark royal intermarriages, encompassing the negotiation of marriage agreements, the subsequent celebrations, and the departure of the bride to her new home.",

Additionally, Biga disproves the idea that the king's mother (Dusigu) and queen (Tabur-damu) accompanied the king on his military expeditions. Specifically, Biga offers a new interpretation of a passage that, according to Archi, suggests the presence of Dusigu and Tabur-damu in a recently conquered town. The author adamantly refutes the hypothesis that Eblaite high-ranking women joined the king in battle, although she suggests the possibility of their involvement in providing assistance during military operations.",

The most compelling evidence supporting the identification of this location lies in the type and quantity of valuable items that were transported from Ebla to Dugurasu. The records from the Great Archive L.2769 make reference to the trade of tin, lapis lazuli, and silver. Additionally, these sources indicate that Ebla imported various precious items, including linen, gold, copper, bronze, hippo and elephant ivory, as well as objects made with precious stones, from Dugurasu.\n\\par\nBiga also examines the broader trade network of precious commodities that existed during that time, encompassing Anatolia, Syria, Babylonia, and Egypt. Another significant factor in the identification process is the connection between the GN DUlu and the city of Byblos, a city renowned for its trade relations with Egypt, which potentially served as a crucial stopover on the route from Egypt to Ebla.\n\\par\nBased on the evidence presented, Biga refutes the suggestion made by Alfonso Archi that Dugurasu corresponds to a city in modern-day Iran (Tukri\u0161).",

Manuscript D was identified by Francesco Pomponio and is attributed to a single hand. While the final comprehensive edition of the manuscripts of the \\emph{VE} is still pending, the paper offers an overview of the glossed entries contained in manuscript D. The paper also emphasizes its uniqueness, noting that it offers a greater number of glosses and often refers to different roots or themes when providing glosses for entries also found in other sources. Additionally, manuscript D shows similarities with the monolingual Sumerian source TM.75.G.2422. Thanks to an almost complete photographic documentation available for manuscript D, the paper further focuses on examining its syllabary. The values and proposed reconstructions of the syllabograms are justified in detail in the second part of the paper, which lists the individual entries of the \\emph{VE} according to the numbering adopted by Pettinato in MEE 4.",

The author investigates the occurrences of the garment \\textsuperscript{tug\u2082}gun\\textsubscript{3} \\emph{u}\\textsubscript{3}-\\emph{ra}\\textsuperscript{(ki)}, suggesting it was a precious fabric often delivered with a sheath and dagger to men. The \\textsuperscript{tug\u2082}gun\\textsubscript{3} can also be delivered to a god (e.g.\\emph{ }\u02be\\emph{a}\\textsubscript{3}-\\emph{da-bal}): the author thus discusses the parallel between the divine couple \u1e24adda-ba\u02bfal/\\textsuperscript{d}BAD-mi\\textsubscript{2} and the royal couple in the marriage ritual. The author further explores the occurrences of \\emph{du-ru}\\textsubscript{12}-\\emph{ru}\\textsubscript{12}/\\emph{rum}\\textsubscript{2} (stole, peplos) and its \\emph{u}\\textsubscript{3}-\\emph{ra}\\textsuperscript{(ki)} variant. Regarding the reading of the term \\emph{u}\\textsubscript{3}-\\emph{ra}\\textsuperscript{(ki)}, Pasquali observes that it has been wrongly interpreted as libir-ra, whereas the signs u\\textsubscript{3} and libir are different. On the basis of a few occurrences of the term \\emph{u}\\textsubscript{3}-\\emph{ra}\\textsuperscript{ }with the determinative for place (ki), he then concludes it may refer to a GN. The city of Ura in Cilicia is the most plausible candidate, as it appears in later documents from Ugarit. The term thus belongs to the group of GNs used to describe the provenance of certain garments or fabrics, such as Mari or Armi.",

    "bibo:note": "The review article by Pasquali discusses Imad Samir's edition of 20 monthly accounts of textiles (\\emph{ARET} XIX). Samir's book is a reworking of his doctoral thesis, defended in 2001. The reviewer highlights that the book comprises three main chapters. The first chapter delves into the accounting practices related to textiles and into chronological details, while the second chapter presents the texts in transliteration along with translations and brief commentaries. The third part contains an index that includes personal names, theonyms, toponyms, and a glossary of lexical terms.\n\\par\nThe reviewer expresses disappointment with the book's analysis of the production and management of textiles within the Eblaite economy. They find Samir's observations and data to be superficial and already well-known to specialists, often lacking proper references. They criticize the author for relying solely on the texts present in the volume and disregarding previously published documentation.\n\\par\nMoreover, the reviewer finds it regrettable that Samir does not explore the connection between textile deliveries and cult or delve into the symbolism of male and female dress during ceremonies. They argue that this lack of depth hampers the analysis of two texts, ARET XIX 10 = TM.75.G.1326 and ARET XIX 20 = TM.75.G.1417, which are considered the most interesting in the book by the reviewer. Text 20 seems to describe a ritual journey by the king to various temples, involving cloth and metal object offerings. Text 10 records fabric deliveries made for Princess Ma'ut's wedding. The reviewer notes that Samir misinterprets the delivery recipients in text 10, and refers to their own previous work on the symbolic significance of clothing at Ebla.\n\\par\nThe review contains further observation on several keywords, verbs, or PNs: \\emph{Da-mi-mu}, \\emph{Ga-si-ru}\u2081\u2082, \u2e22GU\\textsuperscript{?}\u2e23.GA.\u1e2aU, \\emph{Ma-da-ra}, \u02be\\emph{a}\u2083-\\emph{da-um}\\textsuperscript{tug\u2082}(-I/-II), \\emph{ba-a-nu}, \\emph{ba-da-u}\u2084, GA\u2082\u00d7LA\u2082, gir\u2082 mar-tu zu\u2082-AN.AMBAR, GI\u0160-ban\u0161ur, GI\u0160.DUG.DU, GI\u0160-\\emph{ir-zu}\u2082, GI\u0160-u\u0161tin \\emph{Ma-ri}\u2082, GI\u0160-ti-\u1e2aAR, \\emph{gu}\u2082-\\emph{ba-ru}\u2081\u2082, \\emph{gu}\u2082-\\emph{la}-\u02be\\emph{a}\u2083-\\emph{tum, gu-si\u2084-si\u2084, \u1e2bul\u2082, il\u2082, libir-ra\u2082, nam-nam-}su\\emph{\u2083, }ne-da-\\emph{-\u02be}a\\emph{\u2083-}tum\\emph{, }si-ti-tum\\emph{, \u0161ir-za, \u0161u-ke\u0161da, }ti-\u0161a-nu\\emph{, u\u2082-su, }zi-bar-ri\\emph{\u2082.}",

However, despite being dedicated to various deities, there is no mention of a cult image associated with this temple in the sources. Regarding the \\emph{mi-sa-ga-ti-im} rite, the author highlights that the god Hadda plays no role in the transmission of royalty; this duty is assigned to KUra, Barama (his spouse), and the deified ancestors. Drawing parallels with Emar and Ugarit, the author suggests that the worship of deities in the \"temple of the gods\" could be linked to the deified ancestors of the ruling family.",

    "bibo:note": "This paper by Sallaberger explores the role of the god KUra at Ebla during the Early Bronze Age. The author highlights that in polytheistic systems, the functions and realms of a deity are defined and limited by their relationships with other gods. The author notes that the traditions of Eblaite divine names and their roles can be traced to the Mittani kingdom, the Hittite kingdom, and Ugarit. However, the character of KUra, Ebla's city-god, is more difficult to comprehend due to the lack of monumental or narrative texts specifically describing the gods of the local pantheon in Ebla's cuneiform corpus, which primarily consists of administrative documents.\n\\par\nDespite this limitation, the author argues that considering the wider Syro-Mesopotamian horizon is essential to understanding Ebla in the Early Bronze Age. The author initially addresses the interpretation of the divine name written as DN \\textsuperscript{dingir}KU-\\emph{ra}, acknowledging the absence of conclusive evidence regarding whether the name should be understood as Semitic or not. The difficulty of identifying the phonetic representation of the divine name \"Kura\" in later traditions is highlighted, cautioning against a simplistic search for direct correlations. Kura held the position of the tutelary deity of Ebla during the period of the Royal Palace G and its archives. Although no monumental texts specifically describing the local pantheon from this period are available, textual evidence confirms the role of Kura as the city-god of Ebla. Three significant aspects are highlighted: firstly, KUra and Barama symbolize the king and queen of Ebla within the context of the royal ritual. Secondly, KUra receives the most significant dedications and sacrifices compared to other gods worshipped in Ebla. Lastly, oaths of loyalty and allegiance were sworn to KUra, underscoring the deity's central position within the city's religious and social framework.",

The paper highlights the historical importance of Dusigu, the mother of the king of Ebla in the mid-24th century B.C., as the first woman in ancient Near Eastern history to initiate a tradition that continued through the centuries to the Ottoman Empire.\n\\par\nTonietti acknowledges the extensive information available on the king's mother, known as the ama-gal-en, in the works published to date on the women of the Ebla palace. Recently published texts have provided new insights into the ArruLUM period, which was previously poorly documented, and have proposed a new chronological framework for the succession of the last three sovereigns and their respective ministers.
